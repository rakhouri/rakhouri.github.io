          <p>
            Greetings! I'm <b>Richard Khouri</b>, a dedicated sophomore at Clemson University, where my academic pursuits revolve around the dynamic field of computer science, complemented by a focused minor in cybersecurity.<br>
            <br>
            My academic interests span the expansive domains of web development and cybersecurity, reflecting my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and digital security protocols. 
            As a student, I am driven by a passion for understanding and navigating the intricate landscape of coding languages and cybersecurity measures.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to my academic endeavors, I proudly serve as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Intro to Python course. 
            In this role, I contribute to the learning experience by providing guidance and support to fellow students, fostering an environment where programming concepts are demystified.<br>
            <br>
            Beyond the realm of computer science, I extend my expertise as a tutor for both calculus and chemistry. 
            This multifaceted approach allows me to engage with a diverse range of students, offering assistance in grasping complex mathematical and scientific concepts.<br>
